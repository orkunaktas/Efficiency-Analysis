🏆⚽ Football Player Performance and Efficiency Score Prediction 📊🔍

In this study, I evaluated the performance of footballers who played in the 2023/24 season of the English Football League and used various techniques to calculate their efficiency scores. I visualized these scores so that we can better understand the players' performances 🚀📈

Data Set: https://lnkd.in/dKJyuJaZ 

What is xG (Expected Goals) 🥅🔢
xG is a metric that measures the probability of a player's or team's shots on goal during a match. Based on the position and characteristics of the shots, the probability of each shot scoring is calculated and the sum of these probabilities is expressed as xG. This metric provides a more objective measure of performance when assessing a player's goal scoring ability and shot quality, independent of the luck factor.

I used the following factors and weights to calculate the efficiency score:
Goals (Gls) × 2.0
Assists (Ast) × 1.5
Expected Goals (xG) × 1.2
Expected Assists (xAG) × 1.0
Playing Time (90s) × 0.5
Expected Goals (Excluding Penalties - npxG) × 0.7
Progressive Dribbling (PrgC) × 0.3
Sum of Goals and Assists (G+A) × 1.0

Efficiency Score Calculation Method:📏💡
Efficiency Score = (Goals × 2.0) + (Assists × 1.5) + (Expected Goals × 1.2) + (Expected Assists × 1.0) + (Playing Time × 0.5) + (npxG × 0.7) + (PrgC × 0.3) + (Goals + Assists × 1.0)

This formula takes into account multiple factors to more comprehensively assess the overall performance and contributions of the players. Thus, we can more accurately measure the actual contributions of the players.

Efficiency Scores and Leaders:🏅🌟
Player with the Highest Efficiency Score: Cole Palmer 
Top Scorer Erling Haaland (27.0) 🏆⚽
Assist King: Ollie Watkins (13.0) 🏆🅰️
Goal + Assist King: Cole Palmer (33.0)
Pass King: Rodri (376.0)
xG King: Erling Haaland (29.2)
xAG King: Bruno Fernandes (11.8)

Even though Cole Palmer 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶 had the highest score in terms of efficiency score, Phil Foden was chosen as the best player of the season. The main reason for this selection is not only Foden's individual performance but also his contribution to the team's success. Foden's impact on the game and his role in his team's overall success made him stand out as the best player of the season.. 🌟👏
